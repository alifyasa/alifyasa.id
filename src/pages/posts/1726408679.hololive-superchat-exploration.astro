    <Paragraph>
        I scraped Hololyzer's superchat data (<Link
            href="https://hololyzer.net/youtube/"
            >https://hololyzer.net/youtube/</Link
        >). The dataset can be accessed from Google Drive at <code>superchats/2024.csv</code>.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
        I first substituted non-latin channel names with their latin counterparts.
        Then I parse the superchat themselves, separating the currency and amount.

        I encountered a problem when trying to convert the currency to USD, I found
        out that there are no easy ways to obtain exchange rates for a certain date.
        I have to either pay for an API service or manually download from sites like
        <Link href="https://investing.com/">https://investing.com/</Link>.
        Here are some interesting services I found:

    <Heading2>Exploring the Data</Heading2>
    <Paragraph>
        I first tried to explore exclusively IDR superchats. In the end, I decided to
        explore all currencies. I found out about top superchat currencies of 2024 so far,
        top superchat currencies per month, and top channels per currency.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
        I made a chart showing the top channels per superchat currency.
        The chart can be found at the Google Drive link at <code>images/Untitled.png</code>.
        Read more details about the exploration in the <code>ipnyb</code> file at the Google Drive link.
